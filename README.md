# COVID-19 Data Charts for Lithuania

This repo contains R code to generate a set of static charts representing
data on the COVID-19 pandemic in Lithuania. These charts show only past data.

In addition to the R code, github actions have been developed to update the
charts daily, though this is not yet functional (and may not be used because
of the limitations of running actions on a a free account).


Two charts imitating those prepared by the OSP in [their analyses](https://osp.stat.gov.lt/documents/10180/8420714/1_COVID-19_situacijos_apzvalga_210215.pdf).
