Sub-national COVID graphs for France
================

# Plot ridgeline incidence for all level 1 regions

Ridgeline graphs allow for comparison of the incidence in different
regions side by side. These are not *per capita* calculations but just
the daily incidence. There is no smoothing, so weekly variations and
gaps in testing or reporting due to weekends or holidays are visible.

# Plot ridgeline incidence for top 10 level 1 regions

Where there are many level 1 regions, the top 10 regions are displayed.

# Plot ridgeline incidence for top 10 level 2 regions

The top 10 level 2 regions are shown.

The following charts are a form of aggregated heatmap. They are a
stacked column display of the number of regions for each country with
average weekly incidence falling into certain ranges. This gives an
overview of how concentrated a shift in the data may be, but masks
variation as to which regions are being more or less impacted from week
to week.

# Waterfall chart case counts - level 1

# Waterfall chart case counts - level 2

Plotting these charts for level 2 regions typically shows smoother
curves.

# Waterfall chart level 1 region test positivity

This proxy for test positivity is calculated by comparing the number of
new cases each day with the number of tests taken each day.

# Acceleration calculations - national

This acceleration calculation is made based on a proxy for test
positivity calculated by comparing the number of new cases each day with
the number of tests taken each day.
