Sub-national COVID graphs for Switzerland

# Plot ridgeline incidence for all level 1 regions

Ridgeline graphs allow for comparison of the incidence in different
regions side by side. These are not *per capita* calculations but just
the daily incidence. There is no smoothing, so weekly variations and
gaps in testing or reporting due to weekends or holidays are visible.

# Plot ridgeline incidence for top 10 level 1 regions

Where there are many level 1 regions, the top 10 regions are displayed.

The following charts are a form of aggregated heatmap. They are a
stacked column display of the number of regions for each country with
average weekly incidence falling into certain ranges. This gives an
overview of how concentrated a shift in the data may be, but masks
variation as to which regions are being more or less impacted from week
to week.
